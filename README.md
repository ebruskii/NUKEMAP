# NUKEMAP
This is a repository to display my work upgrading the NUKEMAP mobile interface. Although I cannot publically include the backend code, these are my frontend design proposals and iterations. As I designed these pages and user flows, much of the feedback and focus became about leading the user through the detonation in the least clicks possible, while clearly demonstrating options they have.

The "EASY TO UNDERSTAND" page features the most essential panels and flow with clear explanations.
